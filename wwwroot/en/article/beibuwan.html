                    <p>From April 19 to 21, 2017, General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Guangxi. He was very concerned about the opening up and development of Guangxi.

                    <p>Over the past year, Guangxi has made every effort to implement the requirements of General Secretary Xi Jinping, speed up the construction of an international gateway for ASEAN, create a new strategic fulcrum for the opening and development of the southwest, central and southern regions, and form an important gateway linking the maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road in the 21st century, with the construction of the South-Directed Corridor for China-Singapore interconnection as an important carrier. And opportunity to implement the strategy of opening up.</p>
                    <p>Based on location advantages, the development of the "sea going economy" is in full swing. The ancient city head of Dalang Village, Shiwan Town, Hepu County, Guangxi, is the original wharf of the "Han Dynasty Maritime Silk Road". The fleet set out from here in a vast wave and carried Chinese goods along the Maritime Silk Road to Southeast Asia, West Asia and even Africa. Over the past thousand years, ancient port has been replaced by modern port. Beihai Tieshan Port Terminal is busy with many gantry cranes operating at the same time. The running cars shuttle back and forth between the docks and yards. From here, commodities from Australia, Panama and other countries and regions are continuously transported to the southwest, South China and other places.
