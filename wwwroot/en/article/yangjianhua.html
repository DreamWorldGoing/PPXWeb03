            <h2>Polish Hezhou culture "business card":</h2>
            <p>A city's cultural brand will flash like a star in the heart of people.
In 2014, Yang Jianhua served as the director of the Hezhou Federation of Arts and literature, and was responsible for organizing and implementing literary and artistic activities. She has a mind to stand on the post, perform her duties conscientiously, carefully planning how to further polish the "business card" of Hezhou culture.
Together with the Hezhou Literature and Art Federation and the Hezhou literary and art workers, she actively responded to the call of the Chinese Literature and Art Federation, effectively carried out colorful literary and art voluntary service activities, and spared no effort to create a volunteer service brand - "literature and art benefit the people".</p>
            <p>In the past three years, the Hezhou Federation of Literature and Arts has guided the grass-roots cultural federations, literary and artist associations and the vast number of literary and artistic workers to conduct a wide range of voluntary activities, more than 120 performances (times), more than 20 public exhibitions (times) of calligraphy, fine arts, photography, etc., and more than 1000 people (times) of public art training. There are nearly 100 thousand people. Various literary and artistic volunteer service activities, such as Huimin performance, art exhibition, style creation, expert lectures, counseling and exchange, and literary and artistic training, have been held in full swing. "Literature and Art Huimin" this plant rooted in the grass-roots fertile soil of the literary and artistic flowers, in Yang Jianhua and Hezhou Wenlian meticulous watering, Tului bloom, fragrant far Yiqing, become a well-known Huimin brand.</p>
            <p>At the same time, under her guidance, Hezhou's "literary and fine works" project is also steadily advancing: in the creation of the "multi-ethnic writers' Hezhou line" under the background of "one belt and one road", a large number of famous writers focus on "ecological Hezhou and longevity resorts". "Xiaohe Changge" Hezhou excellent original song album music conference was held in Nanning, singing the "ancient road culture" and telling the "Hezhou story"...</p>
            <p>The fragrance of a hundred flowers in full bloom embodies the concerted efforts of the Hezhou literary and artistic federation, the sincere feelings of Yang Jianhua and the Party's literary and artistic workers who are willing to bow their heads to be a cow, and the ardent expectations of the people of Hezhou for the prosperity and development of literature and art.
A solid job will bring honor. In 2014, Hezhou Literature and Art Federation was awarded the title of "Advanced Collective of Thousands of Villages and Households of Literature and Art Project for Benefiting the People" by the district's Literature and Art Federation, and in 2015, Hezhou Literature and Art Federation was awarded the "Advanced Collective" by Guangxi Literature and Art Federation.</p>

            <h2>"Work is beautiful":</h2>
            <p>"Work is beautiful." This is a sentence that Yang Jianhua often talks about. The value of literature and art is to lead people to discover beauty, create beauty and enjoy beauty. When literature and art become daily work, the happiness and happiness of life bloom in the work. In this regard, she enjoyed it.
In the past three years, two of Hezhou's literary and artistic workers have been selected as cultural masters and "four batches of" talents in the autonomous region, four of them have become the object of contact and care of four groups in Hezhou, nine have been awarded the title of "Guangxi Master of Folk Arts and Crafts", 12 have participated in the study and training of literary and artistic institutes, and more than 600 works (pieces) have been written in Hezhou at the autonomous region level. Published or exhibited in the above publications and professional competitions, and won awards. In 2016, five literary and artistic works of Hezhou City won the "Bronze Drum Award" for Guangxi literary and artistic creation.
The reward, the flag and the flowers are devoted to wisdom and sweat. Hezhou's literary and art circles bear fruitful results.</p>
            <p>Firewood is high. In order to further improve the organizational network of grass-roots cultural federations and strengthen the ranks of professional associations, Yang Jianhua and his colleagues fully mobilized all favorable factors to guide the counties (districts) and associations to set up working organizations, develop group members, guide the establishment and development of Hezhou Pinggui Frisbee Cultural Federation, Hezhou Association of Literature and Art Critics, and Babu District. There are more than 300 new members of the grassroots literature and art organizations, such as Daning town literary Union and other members.</p>
            <p>While serving Hezhou literary and artistic talents well, Yang Jianhua also consciously devoted himself to literary and artistic creation, creating prose, Qu art, reportage and other literary and artistic works. He has published (selected editions) in such publications as Ethnic Literature, Quyi, Chinese Reportage, Selected Works of Chinese Minority Literature in the New Period, etc. His works won the Nomination Prize of the Eighth Chinese Quyi Peony Award, the First and Second Prizes of Guangxi Excellent Nursery Rhymes Competition, the First and Second Prizes of Guangxi Quyi Literature Award, the Bronze Drum Award of Guangxi Literature and Art Creation, and the Guangxi Quyi Performance Program Award.</p>

            <h2>Firmly guided by the work of "people centred":</h2>
            <p>Yang Jianhua always regards "people-centered" as his work orientation in the post of the Literature Federation.
From April 2014 to June 2015, Yang Jianhua was appointed Deputy Secretary of the eight district Liantang town Party committee. During her job training, she worked in a row, loved one line, and did solid work for the people.
During her post-holding exercise, she insisted on taking culture and benefiting the people as the main line, serving the construction of key towns as the goal, and earnestly performed her duties. Around the "beautiful countryside" center, she planned and organized a series of cultural activities of "beautiful lotus pond and dream-building countryside", and vigorously carried out publicity and education on the themes of "clean countryside", "beautiful countryside" and "Chinese dream". It will enrich the people's spiritual and cultural life, promote the development of tourism and cultural industry by the projects of "Gubai Ecological Farm" and "Huangwupai Team Training Base".</p>
            <p>While actively organizing and implementing the activities of literature and art benefiting the people and literary and artistic voluntary service, Yang Jianhua has given full play to his professional expertise and devoted himself to the practice of literature and art benefiting the people. In 2015, she ran actively for Shuanglong Village, a poverty-stricken village in Renyi Town, Babu District. She contacted relevant units to carry out caring activities. She gave 200 books to the school and more than 100 sets of school bags and stationery to the left-behind students. The sum is about 100000 yuan... Yang Jianhua's unremitting pursuit is to do a good job to the utmost and let the people enjoy more and better achievements in the prosperity and development of literature and art.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Yang Jianhua has won many honors: advanced individuals in the Guangxi Literature and Art Association System, outstanding literary and art volunteers in the Guangxi Literature and Art Association System, and outstanding Communist Party members in the Hezhou Municipal Government in 2014 and 2015.
In the leadership's eyes, she has a good party spirit and strong working ability. "She is a good Party member, a good cadre, and a good colleague with good experience and strong organizational and coordination ability." Tang Songbo, chairman of Hezhou Literary Federation, said.
In the eyes of her colleague Zhong Qiang, she is a good example, good leader and good elder sister who stresses principle, overall situation and dedication.
Artisans and craftsmen go forward in their dreams. Yang Jianhua told reporters: "the party organization has trained me, and I have done my job and team. As a Party literary and artistic worker, I am given everything by the people, and my work should also be done for the people.</p>
