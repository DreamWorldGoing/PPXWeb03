                    <h2>brief introduction</h2>
                    <p>In 2014, the state formally approved the implementation of the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Zone Development Plan, and the development of the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Zone has become a national strategy. After the implementation of the Zhuxi Plan, the region immediately launched the implementation of the Xijiang Economic Belt Infrastructure Construction Congress, which planned to implement 200 projects with a total investment of more than 630 billion yuan, involving inland water transport, water conservancy, railways, highways, airports, municipal and park infrastructure, sewage and garbage treatment, forestry and ecological projects. In the past 3 years, the total investment has been 156 billion 500 million yuan.

                        <p>The Pearl River-Xijiang River waters, the resource-intensive "Golden Waterway" in southern China, are at one end the economically developed Pearl River Delta, and at the other end the resource-rich southwestern hinterland. Relying on this "golden waterway" to construct a modern industrial agglomeration belt with complementary advantages, coordinated matching and coordinated development, it has unique advantages and unprecedented opportunities.
Three years ago, the promulgation and implementation of the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Zone Development Plan accelerated the pace of coordinated development between the two places. Over the past three years, the region has adjusted its economic structure and productivity distribution by upgrading and developing industries with distinctive advantages, fostering and developing strategic emerging industries, and accelerating industrial undertaking and transfer, so as to provide industrial support for the development of the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Zone.</p>
                        <p>Numbers are the best witness. Over the past three years, Zhuxi region has accumulated 1.53 trillion yuan in industrial investment, an average annual growth of 9.6%. The annual investment increased from 40.12 billion yuan in 2013 to 528.3 billion yuan in 2016, accounting for 82.5% of the region's industrial fixed assets investment. The cumulative investment in technological transformation has reached 1.4 trillion yuan, an average annual growth of 9.2%.
SAIC GM Wuling Baojun Base Project, Dongfeng Liuzhou Liudong Passenger Car Base Phase II Construction Project, Nannan Aluminum Processing Annual Production of 200,000 tons of Large-scale and High-performance Aluminum Alloy Sheet and Strip Profiles, Guangxi Yuanzheng Aluminum Body New Energy Automobile Production Base, Baikuang Group Coal, Electricity and Aluminum Integration Project, Baise Ecological Aluminum Industry Regional Power Grid Phase I Project Cheng, Nanning Foxconn Science and Technology Industrial Park and a number of key projects have been completed and put into production, providing a strong impetus for the steady economic development of the economic belt.
According to statistics, in 2016, the total industrial output value above the economic belt scale reached 1.93 trillion yuan, an increase of 17.68% over the 1.64 trillion yuan in 2014, and 100 billion enterprises achieved zero breakthrough. The economic operation of Guangxi Zhuxi Economic Belt has shown the characteristics of "steady growth, solid investment, rapid industrial transformation, and gradual enhancement of the core driving role of the economic belt".</p>

                    <p>There are 53 navigable rivers in Guangxi and 80% belong to Xijiang River system.
Over the past three years, with the deepening of the construction of the Xijiang Golden Waterway, a number of projects have started construction, completed and put into operation. The 1000-ton waterways of the left and right rivers have been built one after another, and the waterway grade, navigation capacity of the lock and port capacity of the Xijiang River have been significantly improved. Nine locks on the main waterway are all above 1000 tons, and the navigation mileage of the whole area reaches 5873 kilometers, of which the high-grade waterway above 500 tons is 1570 kilometers. Taking Nanning Port, Guigang Port and Wuzhou Port as the main inland ports in China, and Liuzhou Port, Laibin Port, Baise Port and Chongzuo Port as the "three principal and four major" ports in Guangxi, the cargo throughput of Xijiang Port reached 117 million tons in 2016, an increase of 6%.
With the strong support of infrastructure projects, the Xijiang golden waterway is taking off.</p>
                    <!-- 段落 -->
                    <p>"Over the past three years, the construction of the Xijiang Golden Waterway in the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Belt has been generally smooth, a number of major projects have been completed and put into operation or the main body has operational conditions, and the infrastructure system of the Xijiang Economic Belt has been continuously improved to basically meet the development needs of the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Belt." In recent years, a number of waterways have been built, including the 1000-ton waterway from Chongzuo to Nanning on the Zuojiang River, the four-line lock on the third line of Changzhou, the lock on Laokou navigation hub, the Suwan operation area in Guigang, the Daikou operation area in Wuzhou, the Xiangzhou operation area in Baise Port, and the first phase of General Ling in Chongzuo Port. Shiplock and wharf project. At present, the Nanning-Wuzhou section of the Xijiang trunk line has been upgraded to 2000-ton waterway, and the Guiping Second Line Lock and the Changzhou Third Line Four Line Lock have reached 3000-ton waterway. Among them, the annual throughput capacity of the Changzhou Hub Lock exceeds 130 million tons, making it the largest throughput ship lock in China.
By the end of 2016, Guangxi inland river ports had built 517 productive berths, including 152 berths above 1000 tons, 110 million tons of comprehensive cargo capacity, including 1.77 million standard containers, and opened regular liners of containers in the upper reaches of the Xijiang River, such as Baise, Hechi and Laibin. A number of major projects of Xijiang Golden Waterway, such as Guigang, Xijin, Honghua Second Line Lock, Luzhai Jiangkou Operating Area of Liuzhou Port, Setuo Operating Area of Chongzuo Port Central Port Area, have started construction successively.</p>
                    <p>Since 2011, Xijiang Group has expedited the construction of a modern waterborne logistics system of Xijiang, which integrates "Skynet", "Ground Network" and "Human Network" projects. It has started construction of 11 ports and 45 berths, with a total throughput capacity of 19.4 million tons. In 2016, it has completed 5.749 million tons of port throughput, including 92.74 million standard container throughput. The volume of container and bulk cargo transportation was 5.227 million tons; 8 regular liners of containers operated normally, ending the 40-year history of the Hongshui River, Zuojiang River and Youjiang River, saving more than 30 million yuan in logistics costs for enterprises along the Yangtze River.</p>
                    <p>He is strong enough to push ahead. The West River golden waterway has taken off wings.</p>
