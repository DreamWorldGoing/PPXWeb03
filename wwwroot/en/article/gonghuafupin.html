            <p>"Set up a foolish old man's ambition and fight hard battle"... Over the past few days, Guangxi Youth League delegates have focused on General Secretary Xi Jinping's new requirements for poverty alleviation, saying that they should bear in mind their responsibilities and bravely shoulder their mission to speed up poverty alleviation and prosperity in poor areas.
In recent years, Guangxi has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation work, but Zhuang Township belongs to the "borderland of the old and the young" poor areas, poverty alleviation work is very difficult. On March 8, when General Secretary Xi Jinping attended the deliberations of the Guangxi Youth League, he said that poverty alleviation should focus on real poverty, help real poverty, help real poverty alleviation, do less bonsai and do more practical work. It is still five years before a well-off society is fully built. We must set up a foolish will and fight hard battles and never let a minority or an area fall behind.
"The General Secretary urged our village to continue its efforts to double its per capita income in the next five years and build a well-off society in an all-round way in step with the whole country." Luo Chaoyang, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Xinli Village, Naman Town, Tianyang County, recalled the scene of the deliberations with great excitement.</p>
            <p>Representatives Li Zhigang, Secretary of the Laibin Municipal Party Committee, said that the General Secretary's earnest advice on speeding up the work of poverty alleviation in Guangxi was pointed to the "acupoint vein" of poverty alleviation, which was encouraging. The idea of the guests'poverty alleviation and development is very clear, that is, to strengthen the foundation, develop industry, pay attention to training, implement easy relocation and do a good job of accurate poverty alleviation. The goal is to reduce the poverty-stricken population by about 50,000 a year and never stop until the goal is reached.</p>
            <p>The State Council's approval of the Revitalization Plan for the Old Revolutionary Areas along the Yangtze and Yangtze Rivers is of great benefit to the work of helping the poor and tackling key problems in Guangxi. The representative of Baise Mayor Zhou Yiwei said that Baise will rely on this great opportunity to take the entrustment of the General Secretary as a strong driving force for poverty alleviation, creatively carry out accurate poverty alleviation and development, and comprehensively promote the development of the old district.
The general secretary is very concerned about minority areas, especially when it comes to achieving a well-off society in an all-round way. All ethnic groups are indispensable and the representatives of minority nationalities are greatly inspired. Lin Wumin, head of Gongcheng Yao Autonomous County, said that as a mountainous ethnic county, part of the people's income in Gongcheng is still relatively low. "We will intensify our efforts to help the poor, resolutely uproot poverty, so that the Yao compatriots will not be left behind from poverty and prosperity."</p>
