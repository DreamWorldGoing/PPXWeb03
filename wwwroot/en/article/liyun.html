            <p>In 2018, the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up, the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region, Guangxi 14 districts and municipalities have 12 trains, the railway network to achieve the "North, South, East, West Union," from the "end of the road network" to the "regional hub". The convenient transportation network has led to the rapid development of the economy, making Guangxi a new node linking the land and sea trade.</p>
            <!-- 段落 -->
            <p>"The local economy of Guangxi should develop greatly and rapidly, and the railway must also develop greatly and rapidly." Guangxi's economic development can not be separated from the development of the railway, and the development of Guangxi's railway can not be separated from an old railway man who said this, his name is Li Yun. </p>
            <p>　Li Yun, born in 1931 in Tai'an, Shandong Province, participated in railway work when he was a teenager, until he left the post of party secretary and director of the former Liuzhou Railway Bureau (hereinafter referred to as "Liuzhou Bureau") in 1993. He was said to have devoted his whole life to the cause of the beloved railway.
                　　"Xiao Li, you can stay." In 1983, Li Yunyin held a national railway working conference in Nanning and became attached to the Zhuang nationality. In the following ten years, he United and led the cadres and workers of Liuzhou Bureau to strive hard, and made indelible contributions to the reform and development of Guangxi railway and the economic and social development of Guangxi.
                    "We railway, it is a transportation enterprise. Transport enterprises should serve the country and serve the people. With this initial heart, Li Yun always put the national interests and social benefits first.--</p>
            <p>In order to improve the travel conditions of passengers in Guangxi, he conducted in-depth investigation, organized in advance the transformation of railway transport infrastructure, built Qinzhou Station and Fangchenggang Station, and expanded Liuzhou Station into the largest passenger station in the region; opened Liuzhou-Xi'an, Nanning-Guangzhou and other through passenger trains year by year. The Liuzhou-Shanghai express is extended to Nanning-Shanghai, and the Nanning-Guiyang express is extended to Nanning-Chengdu, which further opens up the corridors between southwest and northwest, Guangxi and coastal developed provinces and cities.</p>
            <p>In order to serve the local economic development of Guangxi, he led the cadres and workers in the whole situation to focus on the transportation of fruits, vegetables, raw materials and other key materials in Guangxi, to pay close attention to the key links of safety, management, quality service and scientific and technological progress, and comprehensively improve the railway transport capacity and service quality. In 1985, the Liuzhou-Litang Second Line Railway was built, and the electric centralized interlock was realized on the busiest section of the railway in Guangxi. The annual transportation capacity of the section was increased from 8.71 million tons in 1978 to 52.49 million tons, which solved the bottleneck problem of transportation in Guangxi railway area. From 1990 to 1993, the Nankun Railway (Guangxi section) was constructed. The 731 km railway line from Qinzhou to Beihai, Qinzhou to Qinzhou Port has opened up new channels for Guangxi and southwestern provinces to develop foreign trade.</p>
            <p>What is worth mentioning is that Li Yun puts the safety and safety of passengers in the most important position. By strengthening the safety management of railway transportation, he successively achieved 1169 days of irresponsible major and major accidents, and five years of irresponsible major and major accidents, all of which set the highest national railway record at that time. "Railway transportation is for the public to do the work, so we must first ensure safety, service, and then discuss the benefits." Li Yun always said so, and always did so.</p>
            <p>Taishan is moving. The achievement of these outstanding achievements undoubtedly benefited from Li Yun's management and caring for employees. At the beginning of taking office in Liuzhou Bureau, facing the problems of uneven people and difficult team, he paid close attention to the ideological and working style of government cadres and emphasized "changing more ideas and less people"; in order to make workers in remote stations and districts feel at ease and devote themselves to the railway industry, he constantly improved the living conditions of staff and workers, built staff dormitories and repair schools, and adopted incentive mechanisms. In order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the staff and workers, he proposed to link the distribution of wages and bonuses with the results of management and personal work, to open the ranks, break the "big pot rice", and cadre appointment trial system, removed the "iron chair"...</p>
            <p>"He's been busy for most of his life. He basically doesn't have a home before he retires." Li Yun's wife Liu Heying recalls. Even though retired or even in the prime of life, Li Yun is still in the heart of railway development.
                "I have a high iron dream." When he visited Germany in 1987, Li Yun first sat on the high-speed rail, wondering when China could have its own high-speed rail. In 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin inter-city high-speed railway, was completed; in 2013, Guangxi became the first autonomous region of ethnic minorities to open high-speed railway; in 2018, the high-speed railway in Guangxi reached 1,751 kilometers, ranking among the best in the country - for the long-awaited prosperity of the railway, Li Yun is not only a witness to a thousand feelings. It is a lifelong explorer and founder.</p>
