                <p>From this video let us feel the power of struggle from every ordinary person.
                     On the road of life, no matter who it is, it is impossible to always be a smooth flower.
                    We will experience a variety of "imperequacy", and at this time it will not only inspire you to continue to struggle, but also the longing for a happy and happy life in your heart.</p>
                    <p>The new era is the era of the strugglers and belongs to each of us. In the story of the new era, every person who is struggling is the protagonist. Whether you are an astronaut exploring space, or a taxi driver who returns early and late. Although we are engaged in different jobs, we may not know each other. But we all shine in our respective positions and have a common goal of achieving the yearning for a happy and happy life.
                 We have a great new era, struggling in a socialist country with Chinese characteristics, and every ordinary struggler is confident with full confidence and hope.</p>
